# Framebuffer Polygon Drawer

This project demonstrates how to draw and fill polygons (including polygons with holes) on a framebuffer using Rust and the Raylib library.

## Requirements

  Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs). 

  Raylib Rust bindings
  Add the following to your Cargo.toml dependencies:

```toml
raylib = "4.5"  # or latest available version
```

## Running the Project

  Clone the repository or download the source code.

  Build and run using Cargo:

```code
cargo run
```

Now check the src folder for an file named out.png with the polygon drawed.

To generate and test different polygons (including shapes with holes), check the code inside main.rs. Modify or add polygon point arrays as desired.
